                About me: 
I grew up in Midway, Utah, a charming little Swiss village in the mountains. I loved it!It was thrilling and challenging to ride my bike and run in the mountains.  The fresh air and sunshine fed my soul.  I have always been very interested in exercise and eating whole foods and pursued a degree in exercise. I took my first yoga class in college.  I still remember my teacher.  She was wearing an anklet that would jangle when she walked.  I thought to myself, I want to be like her and am really enjoying this and want more!  My first yoga training was with YogaFit.  That was an intro but I wanted more depth.  I found that through BodhiYoga with my wonderful mentor Syl Carson in Provo, UT.  I did the initial 200hr teacher training which covers Ayurveda, philosophy, anatomy, and how to teach pre-natal yoga, kids yoga, kundalini, flow, yin and several others.I found I enjoyed learning the hands-on adjustments, and was drawn to a second 200hr training-Restorative Partner Yoga with Syl.  Restorative partner yoga is my passion.  It is a one-on-one session that induces deep relaxation.  The receiver is put into passive yoga stretches while the giver is usually in a very similar pose.  My favorite place to do yoga is in nature.  

I have five lovely children and six step-children and six step-grandchildren.It is fascinating to watch them learn, grow and develop into fine responsible citizens of this great country. I love living in Idaho.  I am a nature lover and gardener. I like to bake breads, pies and cakes.  Iâ€™ve even made bagels and English muffins before.  Cycling and walking are activities I enjoy as well. My mother instilled in me an awe for art, culture, and literature.  My father, to grow a business and leadership, anda great respect and love for our founding fathers, our flag, history, our country and the American Dream.  

Why do yoga? 
 I have found for me personally I feel refreshed, calm, and focused after yoga.  There are many health benefits as well such as better digestion and a healthy heart.The poorest of people can practice yoga. Yoga is portable. Anyone can do it, at the very least meditation.There are so many distractions, noise and negativity in the world.  Yoga brings us balance, peace and contentment. Yoga is all about learning to live in the moment and acceptance of self and others.  We are all on our own path and when we accept where others are on their path, there follows serenity.  I have learned to live and think abundantly in yoga.  I have and more importantly AM enough.
